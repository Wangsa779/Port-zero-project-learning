# Port-zero-project-learning
simple port scanning tools inspired by nmap scanning tools, it supported by threading speed to mmake the scanning process more faster.
                         
                         
                            #how to use it
-define the target ip you want to scan (example = 102.29.189.239)
-next put the specific port you want to target (example = 80 )
-after that set how many threading speed from scale 1-100 (example = 20)
-after filling all the data the scanner will analyse the open port inside the ip adress you want to target
